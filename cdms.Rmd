## Cognitive Diagnosis Models

Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are special types of restricted latent class model that have received a great deal of attention in the past several years.

CDMs try to identify if an examinee has mastered specific skills required to solve an item.

CDMs try to identify the strength and weakness in a sets of fine-grained skills(or attributtes) differs from the objective of traditional measurement models.

In CDMs, a student is classified into dichotomous latent skill classes according to the corresponding response of a test and a given *Q matrix* which skills are required to master each item

| Q-matrix| Add | Sub | Multiply|
| --------| ----|-----|---------|
| $7+2$   |  $1$| $0$| $0$|
| $3+4-2$ | $1$ |$1$ | $0$|
|$(5\times 2)+4$| $1$|$0$ |$1$|
|$(3\times 2)-2$|$0$ |$1$ |$1$|

**Q-matrix**

$$Q=\begin{bmatrix} q_{11} & \cdots & q_{1k} &\cdots &q_{1K}\\ \vdots & & \vdots & &\vdots\\
q_{j1}& \cdots & q_{jk} & \cdots & q_{jK}\\
\vdots & & \vdots & &\vdots\\
q_{J1} & \cdots & q_{Jk} & \cdots & q_{JK}
\end{bmatrix}$$

where $J$ means the number of items and $K$ means the number of attributes.

In our case,

$$Q=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1\\ 0 & 1 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$
In educational testing, the attributes required for responding correctly to an item might correspond to specific skills that are usually determined by experts.

Q-matrix indicates whether test item requires that an examinee possess attribute to respond correctly to that item.

**q-vector**
$$q_1=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}, \quad q_2=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}, \quad \cdots$$
